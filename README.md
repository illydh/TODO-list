##  Getting started

I programmed these scripts using VSCode on MacOS. 

To run the scripts, make sure you are in this project's directory - '~/todo-list-site'.

Then, right-click the index.html file and select 'Open with Live Server'.

The user should be redirected to https://localhost:5500/index.html where the site is live.

I may comeback to provide convenient functionality with Python and the Flask package.
